We have graph structure:

Adam	->	Joe	-> 	Sarah	->	
Cara	->	Mary	->	Bill	->	
Tim	->	Sarah	-> 	[and so on]

So, if we start infection from Bill, we shall never infect all persons, 
course there are no references from Bill to Adam or Joe.

Version 1 - No!
In this version we are infect coworkers in such way:
Bill	->	Tim	->	Sarah	-> 	
Cara	-> 	Mary
Bill follows again after Mary, so the feature are going to join infinite loop.

Version 2 - No!
In this version we can see recursion. But this feature are not going to do what we suppose.
When we reach Mary we can see that Bill still health (we infect person after feature call).
So we are going to join infinite loop again.

Version 3 - Yes!
We have the same situation like in Version 1, but there is one important distinction - 
if coworker has flue we'll stop infectioning.

Version 4 - Yes!
We have the same situation like in Version 2, but there we infect coworker and 
only then we join recursion.
