Welcome to Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! If you are reading this, chances are you want to learn Haskell. Well, you have come to the right place.

Haskell is a purely functional programming language. It means, that in Haskell there are no side effects: if a function is called twice with the same parameters, it is guaranteed to return the same result. 

Haskell is lazy. It means, that unless specifically told otherwise, Haskell will not execute functions and calculate things until it is really forced to show you a result.

Haskell is statically typed. It means, that at compilation time it is known where is numbers, strings, etc. This aspect provides more safety to our programs. 

Finally, Haskell is elegant and concise. In Haskell, you spent less time coding and more time thinking.

To start with Haskell, you need your favorite text editor and a compiler. We recommend using GHC, because it is the main compiler (when we say Haskell - more likely we mean GHC, because language and compiler closely linked). The best way nowadays is to use `ghcup` tooling.

Good luck with your Haskell journey.
